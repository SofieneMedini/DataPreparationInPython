# DataPreparationInPython
Functions that allow for loading and parsing your timeseries data, cleaning as well extraction of upper and lower bounds for each series using the 6 sigma methodology (assuming the distibution is  gaussian)
The get_threshold and get_validation_limits methods generate the upper and lower bounds in a csv file. A trend for each timeserie vs. its generated bound is also generated by the same functions.
V1 :{
   Changes:{

	in load_data :
		#excluded the string columns when parsing to float data 
		#fixed the file name to avoid using '/' 

	in  get_thresholds and in get_data_validation_limits
		# added creation of folders "Thresholds Screenshots" & "DataValidation Initial Screenshots" for the related plots
		# added the value of upper limit and lower limit on the plot
		# fixed error related while getting plots ".png" if the tag name contains special caracters
		# Added the number of digits that you want to round the numbers 
		# added df outputs :
			'Tag_Friendly_Name': that takes the tag name as default, that can be changed later on to have a friendly title on the plots
			'Tuned_Lower_Limit': that takes the Lower_Limit as default, that can be changed later on 	
			'Tuned_Upper_Limit':  that takes the Upper_Limit as default, that can be changed later on

    }New:{
	in get_TunedScreenshots 
	# In "the DataValidation.csv" or "Thresholds.csv", Change the'Tuned_Lower_Limit' &'Tuned_Upper_Limit' as desired 
	# it will generate plots of the new tuned lower and upper limit
	# plots found in automatically created folder "../DataValidation Tuned Screenshots" Or "../DataThresholds Tuned Screenshots"


	in get_TunedVsInitialScreenshots function :
	# it will generate plots of the new tuned lower and upper limits vs the original lower and upper limits 
	# plots found in automatically created "../DataValidation InitialVsTuned Screenshots" Or "../DataThresholds InitialVsTuned Screenshots" 
    }
}
